# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

For this project, you will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.


# Instructions (view, train, test my agent)
In order to run this project, be sure to follow the steps and import the proper packages outlined in this [link](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies).  

**Edit:** Additionally, the Banana Unity environment is included in the package structure under _Banana.app_, however if you would like to download your own version, that can be done by following these instructions:

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 


Once all of those instructions are done, start up a jupyter notebook and open the Navigation.ipynb file.  Make sure that the kernel is set to drlnd (setting up this kernel is described in the above link).  Additionally, there are some weird interactions with starting, stopping, and restarting the unity environment so the best bet is to restart the kernel and start the cells from the beginning.  This notebook is used to train my agent which can be found in the same directory in the file _agent.py_ and the model it uses can be found in the same directory in the file _qnetmodel.py_.  The code in the notebook simply just needs to be run sequentially with an optional cell of loading the saved weights and then a cell that runs the trained implementation which can be run any number of times.  Additionally, the saved weights are saved in the same directory in the file _checkpoint.pth_.
